				<h3>What is Refactoring?</h3>
				<p>
					Code refactoring is the process of changing a program’s source code without modifying its external functional
					behavior, to improve some of the nonfunctional attributes of the software.

					<h3>What to keep in mind during refactoring?</h3>

				<section>
					<p>
						It should be done as a series of small iterations rather than re-writing the whole system again. Each
						iteration should be responsible for slightly improving the code while leaving the system in working order.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>
						We should be following Test Driven Development and Continuous Integration during code refactoring. It will
						greatly minimize the risk of introducing new bugs in the system.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>
						We should not “club” Code refactoring with Development of new functionality. Ideally there should NOT be any
						new development during Code Refactoring. Bare minimum, person who is doing code optimization should not work
						on new feature development for that period of time.
