				<h3>Refactoring code</h3>

				<aside class="notes">
					Good morning/afternoon everyone and welcome to my presentation. First of all, let me thank you all for coming
					here today. I'am Iaroslav Silkin.
					The topic of my presentation is refactoring.

				<h3>What is Refactoring?</h3>
				<p>
					<img src="./img/what is refactoring.png" alt="">
				</p>
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						Code refactoring is the process of changing a program’s source code without modifying its external
						functional
						behavior, to improve some of the nonfunctional attributes of the software.
					</p>

					<p>
						Basically it means, re-writing it so that it will be easier to read, understand and easily adapt to changes
						in
						the future. Behavior of the system SHOULD NOT get changed.
					</p>

					<p>Sometimes, Code Refactoring also helps us to cut down the size of the code and improve our performance.</p>

					<h3>What to keep in mind during refactoring?</h3>
					<img src="./img/memes/refactor.jpg" alt="refactor">
					<aside class="notes">
						The goal of refactoring is NOT to add new functionality
						The goal is refactoring is to make code easier to maintain in the future

						If we have testing on the project we should be following Test Driven Development (TDD) and Continuous
						Integration (CD) during code refactoring. It will
						greatly minimize the risk of introducing new bugs in the system.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>
						It should be done as a series of small iterations rather than re-writing the whole system again. Each
						iteration should be responsible for slightly improving the code while leaving the system in working order.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>
						We should not combine Code refactoring with Development of new functionality.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Ideally there should NOT be any
						new development during Code Refactoring. Minimum, person who is doing code optimization should not work
						on new feature development for that period of time.
					</aside>

					<h3>Refactoring According to Standards</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Naming Booleans</h3>

					<p>
						For Booleans, we want to stick to natural language.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						For example, we want to know if a car has a license plate. The result is a Boolean, so we name the variable
						that holds this Boolean hasLicense. To give another example, we want to know if a person is sick so we use
						isSick.

						Both is and has are commonly used prepositions to indicate the variable holds a Boolean.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Looping Arrays</h3>
					<p>
						Last, keep things simple when naming variables for looping arrays. Let’s take a look at the below example,
						which takes a car out of the cars array:
					</p>
					<pre data-id="code-animation">
						<code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
							for (const car of cars) {
								// business logic
							}
						</code>
					</pre>

					<aside class="notes">
						Use the above conventions for refactoring your code. These standards help you to make your code more
						readable.
					</aside>

					<h3>Meaningful Variable Names</h3>
					<p>A name should be descriptive and tell a fellow developer what it holds</p>
					<aside class="notes">

					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Meaningful Variable Names</h3>

					<pre data-id="code-animation">
						<code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>	
							const t = 10; // elapsed time in days
						</code>
					</pre>

					<aside class="notes">
						For example, what if we want to store the number of days that have elapsed? We could a simple one-letter
						variable with a comment. Of course, that’s a bad practice.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Meaningful Variable Names</h3>

					<pre data-id="code-animation">
						<code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
							const elapsedTime = 10;
						</code>
					</pre>

					<aside class="notes">
						To further improve the naming of this variable, let’s try using elapsedTime. Again, this is not a very good
						naming as it does not reveal the type of the variable.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Meaningful Variable Names</h3>

					<pre data-id="code-animation">
						<code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
							const elapsedTimeInDays = 10;
						</code>
					</pre>

					<aside class="notes">
						Finally, let’s try one more time using elapsedTimeInDays. This name is much better as it indicates the
						variable holds a number and explains what the number represents.
					</aside>

				<h3>Don’t Repeat Yourself</h3>
				<h4>Advantages of DRY Code</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Maintainability</li>
					<li>Re-usability</li>
					<li>Resourceful</li>
					<li>Ease of Access</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>Maintaining the code is easier since we already have the logic in place. In case of any
						update, it will be fast since we have to update only at one place, worst case only at few places only
						depending on the application complexity.</p>

					<p>That piece of code can be re-used any number of times.</p>

					<p>Saves time and Space. Initially writing DRY code will take time, however on longer run, it is
						highly beneficial.</p>

					<p>Easier to read, and saves time during the crucial debugging process.</p>
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Modularization</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Shorter functions</li>
					<li>More explicative names to describe the code’s purpose</li>
					<li>Less useless comments</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>We should be organizing our code in multiple modules or functions, where each one is responsible for doing
						single task. It should be in accordance with Single Responsibility Principle or SRP in short.</p>

					<p>If we don’t follow SRP, logic will be scattered around all over the place and it will be very hard to
						understand.</p>

					<h3>Code Smells</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Duplicated Code</li>
						<li>Long Method</li>
						<li>Large Class</li>
						<li>Long Parameter List</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p> Duplicated Code
							bad because if you modify one instance of duplicated code but not the others, you (may) have introduced a
							bug!</p>

						<p> Long Method
							long methods are more difﬁcult to understand
							performance concerns with respect to lots of short methods are largely obsolete</p>

						<p>Large Class
							classes try to do too much, which reduces cohesion</p>

						<p>Long Parameter List
							hard to understand, can become inconsistent</p>

					<h3>Code Smells</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Divergent Change</li>
						<li>Lazy Class</li>
						<li>Speculative Generality</li>
						<li>Temporary Field</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Divergent Change
							Related to cohesion: symptom: one type of change requires changing one subset of methods; another type of
							change requires changing another subset</p>

						<p>Lazy Class
							A class that no longer “pays its way”
							e.g. may be a class that was downsized by a previous refactoring, or represented planned functionality
							that
							did not pan out</p>

						<p>
							Speculative Generality
							“Oh I think we need the ability to do this kind of thing someday”
						</p>

						<p>Temporary Field
							An attribute of an object is only set in certain circumstances; but an object should need all of its
							attributes</p>
					</aside>

					<h3>Code Smells</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Data Class</li>
						<li>Refused Bequest</li>
						<li>Comments (!)</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Data Class
							These are classes that have ﬁelds, getting and setting methods for the ﬁelds, and nothing else; they are
							data holders, but objects should be about data AND behavior</p>

						<p>
							Refused Bequest
							A subclass ignores most of the functionality provided by its superclass
							Subclass may not pass the “IS-A” test
						</p>

						<p>
							Comments (!)
							Comments are sometimes used to hide bad code
							“…comments often are used as a deodorant” (!)
